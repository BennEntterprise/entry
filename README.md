# Kyle Bennett Entrypoint

# About 

Originally Created with CodeSandbox, then migrated to a local development environment and host with vercel.

This project is a React/Typescript frontend that is the entrypoint to my digital persona. It's got links to my relevant Github, LinkedIn and other notables.
